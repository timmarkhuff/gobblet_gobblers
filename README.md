# Gobblet Gobblers

Lab submission for TECHIN 509

Based on the game Gobblet Gobblers: https://themindcafe.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Gobblet-Gobblers.pdf

My version of Gobblers has six unique piece sizes, whereas the traditional version only has 3. 

* logic.py: contains a Game object that tracks the game state and logic
* cli.py: playable version of the game at the command line interface. Can be played human vs human, human vs bot and bot vs bot
* gui.py: playable version of the game with a graphical user interface. Human players only. Requires OpenCV
* tests.py: some unit tests written with the unittest module
